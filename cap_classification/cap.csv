75,We decided to search for what was changed in the algorithm; one of our working hypotheses was that the algorithm might have been altered to make collisions feasible.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
76,We couldn’t find an obvious difference; all the constants and the steps of the algorithm were as expected.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
77,Then we noticed that for short messages only the second 32-bit word was different when compared to the original SHA-1.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

79,By examining how this 2nd word was generated we finally discovered that this was caused by a scope issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
80,"As shown below the SHA-1 function used a variable named f: the function Z() is then called which also uses a variable named f without the var keyword, causing it to be treated as a global variable rather than local to the function.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
81,The end result is that the value of f is also changed in the SHA-1 function which affects the value of the 2nd word for that round and ultimately the whole hash for long messages.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
82,A likely explanation of how this problem came to be is that the variable names were changed to single letters using an automated tool prior to embedding it in the payload.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
83,The 2 f variables probably had different names in the original script which avoided the issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
